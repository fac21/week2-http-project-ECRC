### Core user stories
User stories we need to implement:

- See an interesting mashup of different data (Query at least two APIs using fetch)
- Input information to change the displayed result (Dynamic content generated with JS)
- View the app on all of my devices (A responsive, mobile-first design; ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible)
- Create readme (A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme)

Stretch stories we wanted to also implement:
- As an impatient user, I want to see some indication that data is loading
- As a confused user, I want to be told when something goes wrong

### Plan
- Split into our pairs by themes
- Add estimated velocity and actual velocity to our Kanban Project Storyboard 
- Start Design and workthrough Kanban Board of issues and user stories 



|E1 |E2 | E3| E5|
|---|---|---|---|
|A1 short | A2 story | A3 long | A5 extra long |

- As a team we chose the APIs
  - Giphy
  - MediaWiki (Wikipedia)
  - Musixmatch

- As a team we created the Project in Github, created the Kanban Project Board and assigned the relevant issues and assigned E1, E2, E3 or E5 labels 


### Team Design

- Team design the app for our Week 2 Project 2 
  - Make a logo
  - Create the form containing two required inputs before form can be submitted
  - Create search bar and button to submit 
  - Type CSS, HTML and JS
  - Ensure APIs work with our websites to create mashup of different data

### Barriers and Issues 

![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ContentSmallEidolonhelvum-size_restricted.gif)
 - Several chosen APIs did not work
 - Limited time due to busy schedules and absences
 - Had to go **back to the drawing board and start all over again**

### Re-Plan
- Split into our pairs by themes again
- Add estimated velocity and actual velocity to our Kanban Project Storyboard 
- Choose new APIs and redesign allover again
